# Hospital Patient Footfall Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the average monthly footfall of patients in hospitals. The model aims to provide insights for better resource allocation and operational planning within healthcare facilities.

## Project Overview
The core objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of patients visiting a hospital on a monthly basis. This prediction can be invaluable for hospital management in optimizing staffing, bed allocation, and other critical resources, leading to improved patient care and operational efficiency.
## **Hospital Patient Footfall Prediction Model**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the average monthly footfall of patients in hospitals. The model aims to provide insights for better resource allocation and operational planning within healthcare facilities.

## **Project Overview**

> This predictive model is designed to estimate patient footfall, offering crucial support for hospital management in optimizing staffing, bed allocation, and other critical resources. This leads to improved patient care and operational efficiency.

## **Dataset**

The model is trained using the **"PMC Hospital Infrastructure"** dataset, a publicly available dataset containing details about private and public hospital infrastructure, including an "Average Monthly Patient Footfall" column.

You can find and download the dataset from Kaggle:
[PMC Hospital Infrastructure Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/pmc-hospital-infrastructure)

## **Methodology**

The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The "PMC Hospital Infrastructure" dataset was downloaded.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * **Thorough analysis** of dataset characteristics, distributions, and relationships between variables.
    * **Identification** of potential outliers and anomalies.

3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Handling Missing Values:** Implemented strategies to address missing data points.
    * **Data Type Conversion:** Ensured all columns were in appropriate data types for analysis and modeling.
    * **Feature Selection/Engineering:** Dropped irrelevant columns and prepared features for model training.

    ### Key Preprocessing Steps:
    * *Data Cleaning:* Removing inconsistencies and errors.
    * *Feature Scaling:* Normalizing numerical features for model compatibility.

4.  **Model Development:**
    * **Explored various regression techniques** suitable for predicting a continuous target variable (patient footfall).
    * **Trained and evaluated different models** to identify the best-performing one.

5.  **Model Optimization:**
    * **Applied techniques** to fine-tune model parameters and improve predictive accuracy.

## **Tools and Technologies**

* **Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.
* **Pandas:** Utilized extensively for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* **Machine Learning Libraries:**
    * `scikit-learn`: For implementing various regression algorithms, data splitting, and evaluation metrics.
    * `TensorFlow` (or similar, depending on specific model choices): For potential deep learning models or more complex regression tasks.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** The development environment for interactive coding, analysis, and visualization.

## **How to Run the Project**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/hospital-footfall-prediction.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/hospital-footfall-prediction.git)
    cd hospital-footfall-prediction
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Download the dataset:**
    Download the `PMC Hospital Infrastructure.csv` file from the Kaggle link provided above and place it in a `data/raw` directory within your cloned repository (or adjust the notebook's file path accordingly).

3.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter
    ```
    *(Note: `tensorflow` is optional if your model doesn't use it. You might also need `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualizations if they are in your notebook.)*

5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

6.  Open the `MPR_SEM6.ipynb` (or similarly named) notebook and run the cells sequentially to execute the project.
